Build
	To build this code, you need libpqxx and the postgresql C library dev (i.e. header) files it depends on.

	Ubuntu
		You need to install the libpq-dev package to get the C header files.

	libpqxx
		You can get the latest release code of libpqxx from github:  https://github.com/jtv/libpqxx

		The documentation there and in the release explain the two options for building this library.


Generation

	Schema Generation

		The templates for sql are designed such that you should be able to define a "generic" schema at the parent level and
		then use that to generate product-specific schema config XML files (i.e. Postgresql, MariaDB, SQLServer, etc.).  From
		there the product specific templates can be written without most of the translate tags that would be necessary if they
		were written against the generic parent schema.

		The product-specific schema is generated  by the parent's generate calling each of the child product's generate_schema
		batch files and then calling the child's generate batch file.
