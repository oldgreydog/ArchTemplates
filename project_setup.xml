	The notation "%%root.global.rootTemplatesPath%%" above works very much like the substitution of config values into a template
	but its done by the code that parses and maintains this config file in memory, not the code generator.  It lets you do
	substitutions in the config values here before they are passed to the code generator itself.  That makes it easier to create
	things like the file path(s) below that can be much more generic and easier to maintain that hard coding every place in the
	values that requires the full path(s).

	!!NOTE!! You can change any of these "global" paths to suit your build environment.  These are just for a simple use case in
	the example set.

	!!NOTE2!! If you change anything in this file, you must rerun the setup_projects script before trying to run generate_all.
